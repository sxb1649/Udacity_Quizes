FEATURE

UNDERFITTING/OVERFITTING

Small maximum depth  UNDERFITTING


Large maximum depth OVERFITTING


Small minimum samples per split OVERFITTING

Large minimum samples per split  UNDERFITTING


Large depth very often causes overfitting, since a tree that is too deep, 
can memorize the data. Small depth can result in a very simple model, which may cause underfitting.
Small minimum samples per split may result in a complicated, highly branched tree, 
which can mean the model has memorized the data, or in other words, overfit. Large minimum
samples may result in the tree not having enough flexibility to get built, and may result in underfitting.
