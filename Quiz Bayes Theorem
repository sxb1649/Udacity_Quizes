Suppose you have a bag with three standard 6-sided dice with face values [1,2,3,4,5,6] and two non-standard 6-sided 
dice with face values [2,3,3,4,4,5]. Someone draws a die from the bag, rolls it, and announces it was a 3. What is the 
probability that the die that was rolled was a standard die?

Input your answer as a fraction or as a decimal with at least three digits of precision.


you should think of this problem in terms of the diagrams they showed us in the examples.

Step 1) you know there is a total of 5 die (3 Standard and 2 NonStandard) so you have P(S)=3/5 and P(NS) = 2/5.

Step 2) Ask yourself what are the chances of getting 3 with one of the standard die and do the same with the nonstandard (hint: there are two 3's in NS)... you get P(3|S) = 1/6 and P(3|NS) = 2/6

Step 3) think the Naive Bayesian way... P(S|3) = P(3|S) x P(S) = 3/5 x 1/6 = 3/30 (but you are not done).

Step 4) Get P(NS|3) = P(3|NS) x P(NS) = 4/30 you'll see why in step 5)

Sept 5) Normalize it so that P(S|3) + P(NS|3) = 1 this means divide the "unnormalized" by P(S|3) + P(NS|3)... so P(S|3) = P(3|S) x P(S)/P(S|3) + P(NS|3) =(3/5 x 1/6) / (3/30+4/30) = 3/7

so P(S|3) (the probability that the die is a standard die given that it rolled a three 3) is 3/7
