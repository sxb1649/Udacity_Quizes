Recall that the perceptron step works as follows. For a point with coordinates (p,q)(p,q), label yy, and prediction given by 
the equation \hat{y} = step(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b)  y ^ ​	 =step(w  1 ​	 x  1 ​	 +w  2 ​	 x  2 ​	 +b): 
If the point is correctly classified, do nothing. If the point is classified positive, but it has a negative label, 
subtract \alpha p, \alpha q,αp,αq, and \alphaα from w_1, w_2,w  1 ​	 ,w  2 ​	 , and bb respectively. If the point is 
classified negative, but it has a positive label, add \alpha p, \alpha q,αp,αq, and \alphaα to w_1, w_2,w  1 ​	 ,w  2 ​	 ,
and bb respectively. Then click on test run to graph the solution that the perceptron algorithm gives you. It'll actually draw a
set of dotted lines, that show how the algorithm approaches to the best solution, given by the black solid line.  
Feel free to play with the parameters of the algorithm (number of epochs, learning rate, and even the randomizing of 
the initial parameters) to see how your initial conditions can affect the solution!
