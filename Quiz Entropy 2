What is the entropy for a bucket with a ratio of four red balls to ten blue balls? 
Input your answer to at least three decimal places.

Answer 0.863

Formula : -((4/14) log2(4/14) + (10/14) log2(10/14))




If we have a bucket with eight red balls, three blue balls, and two yellow balls, 
what is the entropy of the set of balls? Input your answer to at least three decimal places.

1.334
-(8/13)log2(8/13)-(3/13)log2(3/13)-(2/13)log2(2/13)
