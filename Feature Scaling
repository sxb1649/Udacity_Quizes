Feature Scaling Exercise
Previously, you saw how regularization will remove features from a model (by setting their 
coefficients to zero) if the penalty for removing them is small. In this exercise, you'll 
revisit the same dataset as before and see how scaling the features changes which features are favored
in a regularization step. See the "Quiz: Regularization" page for more details. The only thing different
for this quiz compared to the previous one is the addition of a new step after loading the data, where you 
will use sklearn's StandardScaler to standardize the data before you fit a linear regression model to the data 
with L1 (Lasso) regularization.

Perform the following steps:
1. Load in the data

The data is in the file called 'data.csv'. Note that there's no header row on this file.
Split the data so that the six predictor features (first six columns) are stored in X, and the outcome feature
(last column) is stored in y.
2. (NEW) Perform feature scaling on data via standardization

Create an instance of sklearn's StandardScaler and assign it to the variable scaler.
Compute the scaling parameters by using the .fit_transform() method on the predictor feature array, which 
also returns the predictor variables in their standardized values. Store those standardized values in X_scaled.
3. Fit data using linear regression with Lasso regularization

Create an instance of sklearn's Lasso class and assign it to the variable lasso_reg. You don't need to set 
any parameter values: use the default values for the quiz.
Use the Lasso object's .fit() method to fit the regression model onto the data. Make sure that you apply the
fit to the standardized data from the previous step (X_scaled), not the original data.
4. Inspect the coefficients of the regression model

Obtain the coefficients of the fit regression model using the .coef_ attribute of the Lasso object. Store this 
in the reg_coef variable: the coefficients will be printed out, and you will use your observations to answer the
question at the bottom of the page.
